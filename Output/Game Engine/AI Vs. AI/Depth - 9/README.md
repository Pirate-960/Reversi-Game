# Warning: Performance Considerations for High Search Depths  

Running the AI at depths greater than 8 may lead to:  

- **Extremely Long Execution Time:** Each run could take more than a day due to the exponential growth of possible board states.  
- **High Computational Demand:** The AI requires extensive processing power, significantly increasing CPU and memory usage.  
- **System Strain:** Machines with limited resources may experience slowdowns, unresponsiveness, or even crashes.  
- **Optimization Needs:** If deeper searches are necessary, consider optimizing the algorithm or running it on high-performance hardware.
